# Mopinion Native SDK for Flutter 

This Flutter Integration SDK contains code to help you use our Android and/or iOS Native/Web SDKs from Flutter.


## Installation
1. Edit the `pubspec.yml` in your `flutter` directory to define the Mopinion Plugin Dependency:

```
dependencies:

  ...

  mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin: ^${latestVersion}
```

2. Run the following command to get the package:

```
    flutter pub get
```

## Native set up

### Android

   1. Open the Android project with Android Studio.
   2. Make sure that your `MainActivity.kt` extends `FlutterFragmentActivity`.
      ```kotlin
      import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterFragmentActivity

      class MainActivity: FlutterFragmentActivity() {
        // Your code...
      }
      ```
   3. Make sure the min sdk is 21 in your `app` `build.gradle`:
   ```groovy
     defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
   ```
   4. In your `Project` `build.gradle` include the Jitpack repository:
      ```groovy
      maven {
        url 'https://www.jitpack.io'
      }
      ```
  1. Sync gradle.
  2. Make sure the app theme extends from a MaterialComponent theme. Please check the [Android Native SDK readme step 4](https://github.com/Mopinion-com/mopinion-sdk-android#step-4) for more info. 
    

### iOS
Install the Mopinion SDK for iOS to make it an available resource for the Flutter plugin.

1. Open in the terminal the `ios` folder and run `pod install` command.
2. Open your iOS project `Runner.xcworkspace` with Xcode.
3. Click on the `Pods` project.
4. Click on `File` option from XCode and click on `Add Package dependencies...`.
5. Search for the Mopinion iOS SDK:
   `https://github.com/Mopinion-com/mopinion-sdk-ios-swiftpm.git`
   It will appear with the name of: `mopinion-sdk-ios-swiftpm`.
6. Remember to add it to the `Pods` project.
7. When the dialog of `Choose Package Products for mopinion-sdk-ios-swiftpm` is opened, select the `Add to Target` dropdown and from the options select the plugin target: `mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin`.
8. Add the package.
9. Add `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` and `Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description` into file `info.plist`.
   ```xml
      <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
	  <string>TEXT_FOR_END_USER</string>
	  <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
	  <string>TEXT_FOR_END_USER</string>
   ```
10. Using `VSCode`, in the folder `ios`, open the file `Podfile` and set the iOS Deployment Target to 11.0 or above.
   Uncomment or add platform :ios, '11.0' to the `Podfile`.
   ```
   # Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project
    platform :ios, '11.0'
   ```
11. Finally run the project from XCode.

## Flutter implementation
In order to use Mopinion SDK for Flutter and start collecting your valuable user's feedback please follow the following steps:

### Import the plugin

Import the plugin class

```dart
import 'package:mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin/mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin.dart';
```

### Initialise the SDK
Initialise the SDK by calling:
```dart
MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.initSdk("YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID", true);
```
The parameter `log` which is the `boolean` after the key, allows to activate the logging in the SDK.
It's recommended to initialise the SDK the earliest possible, an example of where to initialise the SDK:

```dart
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initialize();
  }

  Future<void> initialize() async {
    try {
       MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.initSdk("YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID", true);
    } on PlatformException {
      print("error");
    } 
  }
```

### Calling events
In order to show your forms, call the function :
```dart
MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.event("EVENT_NAME");
```

The `MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.event("EVENT_NAME")` function will also stream an Form State to show in which state the form is. To be able to listen to that callback you can call the function `MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.eventsData()` which returns an `Stream`. Example of usage:

```dart
    Stream stream;
    try {
      stream = await MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.eventsData();
      stream.listen(_setTextEventName, onError: _onError);
    } on PlatformException {
      print("Failed to get events stream.");
    }

    void _setTextEventName(event) {
    setState(() => _yourState_ = event);
  }
```

The Form State callback will be a `String`, and these are the possible Form States:

* Loading ยน
* NotLoading ยน
* FormOpened
* FormSent
* FormCanceled
* FormClosed
* Error
* HasNotBeenShown

More information about the Form States can be found in each readme of the Native SDKs:

[iOS: 2.4.2 Callback variants of the event method](https://github.com/Mopinion-com/mopinion-sdk-ios#242-callback-variants-of-the-event-method)
[Android: Implementing Form State callbacks](https://github.com/Mopinion-com/mopinion-sdk-android#implementing-formstate-callbacks)

ยน These form states are only available in the Android SDK by the moment.

### Adding Metadata

Adding Metadata in the Mopinion SDK is easy, it's achieved by calling the function

```dart
  MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.data(Map);
```

This function will receive a `Map<String, String>` variable which will contain the metadata you want to set in your events. Example of usage:

```dart
  Map<String, String> map = {
        "age": "29",
        "name": "Manuel"
      };
  MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.data(map);
  MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.event(yourEvent);
```

#### Deleting Metadata by key
When a key data from the Metadata `Map<String, String>` provided to the SDK wants to be deleted then we should just pass the `key` value as the following:

```dart
  MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.removeMetaData("name");
```

This will remove the key `name` from the Metadata `Map` provided.

#### Deleting all Metadata
When all Metadata wants to be deleted, it's even simpler, just call 

```dart
MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.removeAllMetaData();
```
And all Metadata will be deleted.
